I just got a new Mac for work and I'm working on setting up this new computer. 
There's quite a number of tools I didn't realize I needed to use. I figured I'd 
list out everything here so I don't have to do another brain dump in the future 
in case I get a new computer. Also, could be useful for other junior engineers 
that join the team.

### Applications

* Alfred for fast app launching. Kind of like `cmd+space` on steroids.
* Transmit for connecting to remote servers (SFTP, S3)
* Sublime Text for general purpose text editing
* Chrome and Firefox
* Divvy or Spectacle for windows management
* 1Password for password management
* iTerm2 for a more customizable and user friendly terminal emulator

### Extensions

* JSONView (for prettying json data)
* Postman (for creating HTTP requests)
