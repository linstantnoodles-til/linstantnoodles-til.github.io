Today we migrated our gulp build commands into NPM Scripts and learned a bit 
about NPM scripts in the process.

NPM scripts allow you to specify shell commands that can be run with `npm run`. 
These commands are specified as key-value pairs in a `scripts` object inside 
`package.json`. 

#### Defining commands

```
{
    "name" : "foo",
    "dependencies" : {
        "bar" : "0.1.x"
    }, 
    "scripts": {
        "hello" : "foo ./hello",
        "world": "bar ./world"
    }
}
```

With the configuration above, the command `foo ./hello` will be run using `npm 
run hello`. Before NPM executes the command in a shell, it adds the local node 
modules directory `./node_modules` to the $PATH. This is ideal because when we 
execute node binaries for a project, we want to run the locally installed 
version rather than the globally installed one.

You can see a list of all the available commands by running `npm run`.

#### Passing arguments

You can also pass arguments to commands with NPM Scripts. This can be 
accomplished by having `--` in front of the same of the command you want to 
run.

```
"scripts": {
    "hello" : "foo ./hello",
    "world": "npm run hello -- --argument-one=world"
}
```
