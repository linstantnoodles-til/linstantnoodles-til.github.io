* If you install the [Angular Batarang][batarang] chrome extension, you can 
  view the scope tree of your application in different ways. For example, if 
  you go to the elements tab of the developer tools, on the right pane which 
  displays information about the current element will be a new option called 
  `AngularJS Properties`. Clicking it will show you the current scope object 
  associated with that element.
* Using the `for` attribute in labels to associate it with form controls is 
  good for accessibility.
