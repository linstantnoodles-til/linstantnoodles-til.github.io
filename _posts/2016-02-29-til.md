* If you install the [Angular Batarang][batarang] chrome extension, you can 
  view the scope tree of your application in different ways. For example, if 
  you go to the elements tab of the developer tools, on the right pane which 
  displays information about the current element will be a new option called 
  `AngularJS Properties`. Clicking it will show you the current scope object 
  associated with that element.

* Using a label and using the `for` attribute in labels to associate it with 
  form controls is a best practice. Having the `for` attribute enables to 
  browser to pass the focus to the control when the label is clicked. This is 
  very good for accessibility because it means there's a greater clickable area 
  for the input which is ideal for people with poor motor skills. Having this 
  association is also good for screen readers because users can get more 
  information about the label when they're on a control. [More
